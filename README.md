# CS710S-JAVA-APP-for-ANDROID

CS710S Android Java Bluetooth Demo App and SDK

This application provides demonstrations to the programming interface made available for configuring, controlling, and accessing the CS710S RFID reader. The development was based on the CS710S Java API.

## Pre-requisite 

The development environment consists of the following:
- Android Studio Giraffe
- Android SDK API Level 36 (compileSdk 36, minSdk 26, targetSdk 36)
- Microsoft Windows 10/11 or Mac OSX or Linux

# AI Tools & Workflow in Development  

This project applied AI tools to assist in code analysis, refactoring, and pruning, ensuring a structured and safe process for maintaining the repository. The workflow emphasizes repeatability and clarity for both new and experienced developers.

## AI Tools
  - **Grok (by xAI)**, **Claude (Anthropic)**, or **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**

## AI Objectives  
  - Handling large contexts (e.g., ~9M+ character repomixed codebase).
  - Deep repository “prospecting” (dependency mapping, structure analysis from `CS710S-Java-ENTIRE-CONTEXT.txt` or `CS710S-Java-ENTIRE-CONTEXT.xml`).  

## General Workflow  
1. **Preparation**  
   - Backup repo (`git branch prune-<feature>`).  
   - Load in Android Studio (Windows/Mac/Linux).  

2. **AI-Assisted Prospecting**  
   - Upload `CS710S-Java-ENTIRE-CONTEXT.txt` or `CS710S-Java-ENTIRE-CONTEXT.xml` to your preferred LLM.
   - Query LLM with specific context (see prompts from `prompts.md`).  

3. **Iterative Pruning**  
   - Target one feature at a time (e.g., “Register Tag”).
   - Trace dependencies:
     - Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, etc: ensure all nested references are cleanly acknowledged
     - Holistically remove imports, update refs

4. **Verification**  
   - Rebuild
   - Confirm build remains clean
   - Test preserved features, ensure application runs as expected.
   - Run on emulator/device, check logs.
   - Publish incremental commits ensuring backtracking is possible.  

5. **Documentation**  
   - Update README and related supporting files.  
   - Review and borrow prompts/templates from (`prompts.md`).

## Notes on Android Studio Workflow (With Emulator)
1. **Clean the Project**: In Android Studio, go to `Build` > `Clean Project` to remove all compiled files and ensure a fresh build.
2. **Sync and Rebuild**: Select `File` > `Sync Project with Gradle Files`, then `Build` > `Rebuild Project` to compile.
3. **Deploy to Emulator**: Configure emulator (e.g., x86_64), select `Run` > `Run 'app'` to deploy and run.

## Notes on Repomix
The `CS710S-Java-ENTIRE-CONTEXT.*` files are comprehensive, packed representations of the entire codebase, generated by Repomix—a tool that consolidates source code, projects, and docs into a single, AI-consumable format (e.g., .txt or .xml). The `repomix-config.json` file configures Repomix to include/exclude files, define output structure, and ensure full content without truncation, tailoring the pack to our needs. This setup makes our codebase "AI Ready" by enabling deep analysis of BLE/RFID flows, dependency mapping, and optimization suggestions via AI tools like Grok, Claude, ChatGPT, etc, streamlining development and maintenance for the CS710S app.

- Select either `CS710S-Java-ENTIRE-CONTEXT.txt` or `CS710S-Java-ENTIRE-CONTEXT.xml` based on LLM upload policies. Both contain identical content; the only difference is the file extension, which supports different formats.
